      "info": "Tunis is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as Grand Tunis, has about 2,700,000 inhabitants. As of 2020, it is the fourth-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers and Tripoli) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world.\n\nSituated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (Ḥalq il-Wād), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by media and travel guides as the Tunisian Champs-Élysées), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. As the capital of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the centre of the country's commercial and cultural activities. from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis",

      "info": "While the origin of the pierogi is often under debate, the exact origin of the dish is unknown and unverifiable. It likely originated somewhere in Central Europe or Eastern Europe, and has been consumed in these regions long before any of the present political nations existed. Today, it is a large part of many Central European and Eastern European cultures.\n\nOne legend relates that in 1238, Hyacinth of Poland visited Kościelec, and on his visit, a storm destroyed all crops; Hyacinth told everyone to pray and by the next day, crops rose back up. As a sign of gratitude, people made pierogi from those crops for Saint Hyacinth.[15] Another legend states that Saint Hyacinth fed the people with pierogi during a famine caused by an invasion by the Tatars in 1241.[15] One source theorizes that in the 13th century, pierogi were brought to Polish territories by Hyacinth of Poland from the Far East (Asia) via eastern neighbors such as Kievan Rus'.[16] None of these legends is supported by the etymological origin of the root pirŭ- from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi",

This ancient cereal, familiar to the Mediterranean and Arabic countries, has an unusual green color, and resembles the more popular bulgur. Chorba frik is a dish that is usually associated with the eastern parts of the country, but it can be found throughout Algeria. Since it is highly nutritious, it is often served on its own. Various breads or a traditional Algerian flatbread, kesra, are usually served on the side. The dish is typically served on Ramadan, after breaking the fast. On Ramadan, a bowl of chorba frik is usually served with borek – a crispy pastry filled with minced meat. from: https://www.tasteatlas.com/most-popular-dishes-in-algeria",

The timing of the second meal - “sohour” - is variable according to personal preference, but usually delayed as much as possible until just before dawn. In between “iftar” and “sohour”, people are allowed to eat and drink liberally.\r\nAfter breaking the fast at sunset, the city comes to life with different activities, shopping malls and at the hotels, where Ramadan theme tents are set up and folkloric entertainment is held on a nightly basis. Sitting in one of the cafes on the Nile is also very pleasant, where there is light entertainment and good food offered. The mosques are all lit up, shops are open almost all night, the streets are decorated in Ramadan themes, and the food displayed in the shops is the customary offered especially during the holy month.\r\nEgypt has a different flavor during the holy month. As August tends to be a warm month, it is best to plan the schedule where the most famous ancient and religious sites in Egypt are to be covered earlier in the day, followed by museums that tend to open a little later during Ramadan.\r\nAs the day gets warmer, the shopping malls such as City Stars in Nasr City suburb or First Mall in Giza, are a delight\r\nto browse around in, where local and famous brand merchandise are displayed in shops, food outlets and other entertainment is available.

Oram and Frederik Pedersen, authors of \"Viking Empires\" (Cambridge University Press, 2005). During this time, the reach of the Scandinavian people extended to all corners of northern Europe, and many other nations found Vikings raiding their coasts. The farthest reported records of Vikings were in Baghdad for the trading of goods like fur, tusks and seal fat.\r\nA Viking raid on the monks of Lindisfarne, a small island located off the northeast coast of England, marked the start of the Viking migration from Scandinavia in 793. This location was a well-known abbey of learning, famous throughout the continent for the knowledgeable monks and its extensive library. During this raid, monks were killed, thrown into the sea or taken as slaves along with many treasures of the church, and the library itself razed. This single event set the stage for how Vikings would be perceived throughout the Viking Age: savage warriors with no respect for religion or appreciation for learning\r\nfrom: https://www.livescience.com/32087-viking-history-facts-myths.html\r\n",

It has a rich history as Hieropolis was once an important religious epicenter following the acceptance of Christianity by the emperor Constantine and his establishment of Constantinople (modern Istanbul) in 330 A.D.\r\nToday, remains of the ancient city include baths, temple ruins, a necropolis and a massive theatre. Pamukkale was formed when a spring with a high content of calcium bicarbonate cascaded over the edge of the mountain cliff, which cooled and hardened leaving white-coloured calcium deposits and aquamarine mineral-rich water.\r\nThe calcium-filled travertines cascade down nearly 200 metres and resemble frozen waterfalls, pooling down into shallow natural thermal spring basins – together with the ancient city and ruins of Hieropolis, Pamukkale was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.\r\nfrom: https://www.yogawinetravel.com/overtourism-in-pamukkale-is-it-worth-visiting-turkeys-cotton-castle/",
